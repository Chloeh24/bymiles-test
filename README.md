# ByMiles tech test

Create a simple web application with a login screen which takes a username and password. Once authorised, it will navigate the user to another page which will display policy details.

## To run

1. clone this repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run start` to start server
4. run `npm run test` to run tests

## User stories

- [x] As a policy holder, I can login successfully and view my current policy information so that I can view my policy details

## Notes

- Focused on functionality and readability of code
- Assumed that there is no need for form validation as it's using dummy data
- Added a logout button for easy navigation and reusability
- Time taken: approx. 4 hours

## Improvements

- Test the Login and Policy page components more thoroughly, maybe using Enzyme
- Add a loading circle instead of 'please wait' for nicer UX design
- Edit and improve on styling e.g. use a card design for 'my policy' page
