## User stories

- [x] As a policy holder, I can login successfully and view my current policy information so that I can view my policy details

## Notes

- Focused on functionality
- Assumed that there is no need for form validation as it's using dummy data
-
- Time taken: approx. 4 hours

## Improvements

- Write
- Add a loading circle instead of 'please wait' for nicer UX design
- Edit and improve on styling e.g. use a card design for 'my policy' page
